    "# Dataset Source:\n",
    "# I found this dataset on Kaggle (Titanic Dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variables:\n",
    "# X1 (independent variable): Pclass (ticket class: 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)\n",
    "# X2 (independent variable): Age (passenger's age)\n",
    "# Y (dependent variable): Fare (ticket price paid)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why I chose these:\n",
    "# - \"Pclass\" is numeric (ordinal: 1, 2, 3) and strongly relates to ticket cost.\n",
    "# - \"Age\" is numeric and may also influence ticket price (e.g., adult vs. child).\n",
    "# - \"Fare\" is a continuous numeric variable, making it a suitable target for regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why this is a good prediction sample:\n",
    "# - The Titanic dataset is well-known and provides enough rows (891 passengers) to train and test a regression model.\n",
    "# - \"Fare\" is continuous and works well as Y, while \"Pclass\" and \"Age\" are solid numeric predictors.\n",
    "# - This setup allows us to practice multiple regression with real-world data while avoiding classification targets like \"Survived.\"\n"
